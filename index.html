      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="myImage.jpg" class="auth-image"  alt="Kala">

      <p>This is the story of girl, who tried at coding and drowned in that world. That girl's name
        is Kala
        Elam, and that's me. At 32, for reasons we won't get into, I would assume a small stroke or
        temporary loss
        of sanity, the genius that I am decided to switch careers again, for the third time.
        Which is how I found myself entering into the world of web development.
        To say it is stressful and intimidating is a given, but it's also fun and thrilling and rewarding.
    </p>
    <p> I graduated from Texas Christian University with my bachelors degree in
        Speech Pathology and immediately started working as
        a pediatric Speech Therapist. That same year I found yoga and felt joy for the first time in my
        life, and
        after two years of blood, sweat, pulled muscles, and some zen, I became a certified yoga instructor.
    </p>
    <p> It didn't take long for me to crave a new thrill in my life, and loving to travel, but
        hating to fly, I
        decided to become a Flight Attendant. I learned to love flying but knew that it was a temporary
        hiatus from
        real life, and bonus, avoiding the marriage and baby lectures from friends and family. After two
        years in
        the hedonistic airline industry, I knew it was time to leave with the shredded remains of my soul.
        And so
        ends the tale of
        how I ended up in the SMU web development bootcamp, trying to make my brain function again after
        years of
        sleeplessness and alcohol abuse.</p>
